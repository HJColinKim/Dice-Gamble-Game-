# Dice-Gamble-Game-
Very basic game designed with Javascript, HTML and CSS. Based on the 'Pig Game' from the famous web developer Jonas Schedtmann in his Javascript Course. 

The game is played with two players (in real life in close proximity). The game follows a loop where one of the two players must reach a score of 20 and cash-out before the other.
Players earn scores by rolling a random dice.

The trick to the game is, if a player rolls a one, their turn ends immediately, and their temporary gains are lost to the void! Each player has to choose a good balance of playing risky
and playing safe

The interface of the website readily changes to fit the game-state, and all the features are fully functional.
